  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate, excited, and meticulous college student working towards my undergraduate degree in Physics and Mathematics with my sights set on an advanced degree in the former. I have a plethora of technical and interpersonal skills that allow me to quickly become a valued member of any team I am a part of. I have spent countless hours developing my personal familiarity with physics, taking the time to understand and consume relevant scientific literature. Two particular special interests of mine are quantum sensing, and particle physics beyond the Standard Model.
